## Software Requirements & Resources
#### Downloading and installing R
You can get R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).  Download and install the latest version from http://cran.r-project.org/, if you don’t already have a copy. This installs the R program, which you could use to do most subsequent R tasks. 

#### Optional: Installing R Studio
R Studio is a popular, enhanced interface for R known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It does helpful things like organize your workspace and add color to your code for easier reading.  It also has a lot of advanced functionalities that extend R’s capabilities. You don’t need to use it, but it’s available at http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/.

#### Familiarity with R
You will get the most out of the workshop if you are familiar with R and its basic syntax and data structures. If you are a beginner, you can find a good list of interactive tutorials at http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R. Both DataCamp and Try R allow you to learn basic R commands online with no installation overhead. We also like the interactive “swirl” tutorial package mentioned, which teaches you R from within your own R installation on your computer (instructions at http://swirlstats.com/students.html).
