# Intro-Spatial-R
This repo contains all the scripts and materials used for the student-oriented workshop, "Using R to Model, Manipulate, and Manage Spatial Data," originally presented at the 2015 IALE World Congress in Portland, Oregon.

### Original Workshop Instructors & Contributors
Jill Deines, Tom Edwards, Whalen Dillon, Karl Jarvis, Francesco Tonini

## Workshop Contents
### Module 1: Getting GIS Data In and Out of R
* M1.1: Importing and Exporting Vector GIS Data in R
* M1.2: Importing and Exporting Raster GIS Data in R

### Module 2: Projections, Resolutions, and Extents

### Module 3: Modifying GIS Data in R
Demonstrates the development of a workflow to manipulation and prepare data for further analysis.

* How to query the data table of vector data.* How to calculate new field for vector data.* How to convert raster to vector & vector to raster.* How to subset/mask data for analysis.

### Module 4: Analyzing GIS Data in R

### Module 5: Interactive Online Mapping and Visualization

## Software Requirements & Resources
#### Downloading and installing RYou can get R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).  Download and install the latest version from http://cran.r-project.org/, if you don’t already have a copy. This installs the R program, which you could use to do most subsequent R tasks. #### Optional: Installing R StudioR Studio is a popular, enhanced interface for R known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It does helpful things like organize your workspace and add color to your code for easier reading.  It also has a lot of advanced functionalities that extend R’s abilities. You don’t need to use it, but it’s available at http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/.#### Familiarity with RYou will get the most out of the workshop if you are familiar with R and its basic syntax and data structures. If you are a beginner, you can find a good list of interactive tutorials at http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R. Both DataCamp and Try R allow you to learn basic R commands online with no installation overhead. We also like the interactive “swirl” tutorial package mentioned, which teaches you R from within your own R installation on your computer (instructions at http://swirlstats.com/students.html).
